# RoBot - Discord Bot

RoBot is a fun and educational personal Discord bot project developed and maintained by Allan Li and Johannes Lintula. It is written in JavaScript and the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome) library (currently running version 12.2.0). Currently, the main features of the bot include posting gifs from Tenor, creating polls, and tipping users. Additionally, ideas for new features and improvements are regularly updated in [project kanban board](https://github.com/Alzuu/discord-bot/projects/1).

## Learning goals
RoBot is meant to be a personal learning project. The main focuses include increased proficiency and experience in JavaScript, MongoDB, software engineering best practices, as well as cloud hosting. In this case, the personal bot is hosted on [Heroku](https://heroku.com), and the database is hosted on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
